# Ball Bounce

## Project Overview:
Hello! This is my project using C++ and OpenGL to create 2D brick-breaker game I call Ball Bounce. 

The premise is simple: use the paddle to bounce the ball into the bricks and clear the level. The game is space themed, so the ball looks like the moon and each level will take to you a new wonder of space.
There are currently three special types of bricks: the cloning brick, the enlarging brick, and the bouncy brick. The cloning brick spawns another ball at the position of the paddle with an initial velocity.
The enlarging brick doubles the radius of the ball that collided with it. The bouncy brick increases the velocity of the ball that collided with it by 10%.

## The Code:

Documentation for the C++ code can be found [here](./ball-bounce/BallBounce). There are some files in the base folder but others can be found organized into the game, graphics, and levels folders respectively.

## In Action:

## Try it out!

TODO: Improve level flow and add more special bricks.
